      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2020, our company started with a simple mission: to make mosquito exterminating technology accessible and useful for everyone.
        Tatiana and Nathaniel met during a mosquito apocalypse and realized their shared vision of creating products to solve the mosquito problems.
        Over the years, they built a dedicated team, launched innovative solutions, and grew into a community-focused brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in transparency, creativity, and continuous improvement.
        Our commitment is to bring the best experiences to our customers while fostering a supportive work culture.
